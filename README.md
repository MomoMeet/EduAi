# EduAi Automated Notes-Making Support System

EduAi is a Flask-based web application designed to assist students in capturing and organizing information during fast-paced lectures. Using advanced technologies such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Generative AI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the app transcribes lecture audio, identifies key concepts, and generates structured notes. It is particularly useful for students in multilingual environments and helps improve retention and revision efficiency.

## Overview

Over 60% of students struggle to capture and organize information during fast-paced lectures, leading to poor retention and revision. Additionally, 25% of students come from multilingual backgrounds, making it harder for them to engage and understand the content fully. EduSpot AI Notes Maker addresses this by automatically detecting key terms during lectures, transcribing audio in real time, and generating structured notes to improve understanding and retention.
